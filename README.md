#  Prompt Engineering Showcase

> “Designing prompts that think before the AI does.”

This is not just another prompt repo.  
It’s a collection of thoughtfully structured prompts, evaluation templates, and real-world GenAI design patterns — built to show how a human mind can steer AI systems smartly.

Built by **PromptCrafter91**, a curious mind exploring the art and science of prompting.

 Why This Repo?

Because prompt engineering is not about tricking the AI —  
It's about **guiding it like a good conversation**.  
This repo reflects a hands-on journey of learning how to write prompts that **respect the task, the user, and the machine**.
